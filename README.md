[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/tile38/msgkit?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/tile38/msgkit)


msgkit is a quick and easy websocket message handling package for Go.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/tile38/msgkit"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize a msgkit handler
	s := msgkit.NewServer(nil)

	// Bind a response handler to any JSON message with the "type" of "Echo"
	s.On("echo", func(so *msgkit.Socket, msg string) {
		so.Send("echo", "Hello World!")
	})

	// Bind the handler to url path "/ws"
	http.Handle("/ws", s)

	// start serving on port 8000
	srv := &http.Server{Addr: ":8000"}
	log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServe())
}
```

## The Idea

The msgkit payload is a JSON payload containing AT LEAST a message type. Any
websocket message with a "type" field will be passed to its respective handler
defined in your go code. You can choose to nest payloads within another field 
in your JSON message or pass fields at the parent level.

Note: The "type" should indicate both your method AND resource if applicable.

#### A request for an account with ID 1234
```
{
    "type": "Account",
    "id:": 1234,
}
```

#### A message with the text "Hey guys!"
```
{
    "type": "Message",
    "text": "Hey guys!"
}
```

#### A request to create an account
```
{
    "type": "Create-Account",
    "account": {
        "name": "Mike",
        "username": "Mike1234",
        "password": "Goforlife997"
    }
}
```
